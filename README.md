# React Prototype - Calvin and Hobbes Collection Manager

##### by Andrew Wasicek

-----------

## Objective

The goal of this project was to begin to learn and practice the fundamentals of React
without the assistance of state management libraries such as Redux or MobX (or other React libraries that might assist in UI building for that matter).  As such, this is purely a front-end exercise and there is no database or other forms of persistence.
